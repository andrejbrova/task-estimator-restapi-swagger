Predicting task complexity based on employee task history. Using Python as programming language and Machine Learning models. Everything is wrapped in a RESTful API.
Employee's tasks are categorized based on similarities and attributes (Cliend ID, Project ID, Use of similar programming languages and tools...)
Task complexity can be one of four categories: EASY(takes 1 to 3 hours to finish task), MEDIUM(takes 3 to 6 hours to finish task), COMPLICATED(takes 6 to 12 hours to finish task), OVER-COMPLICATED(takes more than 12 hours to finish task).
